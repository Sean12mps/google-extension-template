# google-extension-template
My testing template for creating a google extension.

Pull the repo, configure the package.json and install it. After installation, you can start developing it by using grunt command.

```bash
$ npm install
$ grunt
```

You may want to configure the manifest.json first before anything else. All of the would-be-distributed codes should be compiled in the pkg folder, while your development codes would be in app folder.
